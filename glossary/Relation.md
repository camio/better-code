A set of ordered pairs mapping [Entities](Entity.md) from a _domain_ to a _codomain_. A relation is distinct from a _function_: the first entity does not uniquely determine the second entity. A [[Relationship]] is the way two entities are connected.

A relation implies a _corresponding predicate_ that tests if a pair exists in the relation. If it is true, we say the relationship is [[Satisfied]].
