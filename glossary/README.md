# STLab Glossary 

**The contents of this directory should be considered alpha-quality**. 

The glossary is currently compatible with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), but this support is not guaranteed in the future. Cross-file references may be made with double-brackets, like: `[[Term]]`.

Each file in this directory, (except this README) shall define a single term relevant to rigorously-specified programs. A file's presence here indicates STLab's belief that the associated term is used enough to merit a rigorous definition.

For each term, please provide a `# Resources` section pointing to materials that either explain or use the term in an exemplary manner.
