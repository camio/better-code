Describes an [[Object]] which can only be assigned-to or [Destructed](Destruction.md). Semantically, an invalid object has no meaning.

The validity of an object cannot be tested with a [[Predicate]]. It is a "flow-dependent" state of the application. Determining the validity of an object is only possible with full knowledge of a system throughout time. 

Note: This is related to the notion of a _partially formed_ object, as defined by Elements of Programming.

Note: "destructible" and "assignable-to" are [[Transitive]].
