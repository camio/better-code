Describes an [[object]] which can only be assigned-to or [[destructed]].

The validity of an object cannot be tested with a [[predicate]]. It is a "flow-dependent" state of the application. Determining the validity of an object is only possible with full knowledge of a system throughout time. 

Note: "destructible" and "assignable-to" are [[Transitive]].
