A pair of positions (also known as "bounds") in a [[Sequence]]. Unless otherwise specified, a range is _half-open_, meaning its upper bound is excluded. A range may also be _closed_, which means it includes its upper bound. 

**Note**: the use of this term to refer to the **codomain** of a function is discouraged. It is an unnecessary name collision for a concept that has an appropriate term.
