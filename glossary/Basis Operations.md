The set of [operations](Operation.md) which are irreducible at a particular [[Abstraction Layer]]. 

# Background
The term is borrowed from Linear Algebra, which defines a **basis** as a set `B` of vectors in a vector space `V` such that every element of `V` is uniquely expressible as a finite linear combination of elements of `B`.
