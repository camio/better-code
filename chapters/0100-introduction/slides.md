We hope this course/book is generally applicable, but of course we come from a
set of experiences that will color what we think is important.  We've attempted
to be responsible for our biases, but in full disclosure, here they are.

## Engineering

{{ note }}
This is a course about engineering.  So what do we mean by that?

- Consulting definitions very useful; we will do that a lot.
- Wordy definition, but some standout features:
  - it's a creative process
  - Based on scientific principles
  - to create predictable results
  - subject to real-world constraints (functionality, economics, safety, shipping dates,
    cost, Available tooling/hardware, laws of physics…)
  - correctness is provisional. The fact that the computer might get struck by
    lightning doesn't make your code unreliable. “specific:” the provisions are
    *specified*

</div>

{{ note }}
As engineers we have to juggle all of this and make a set of informed
tradeoffs to find the best solution.  Real-world constraints mean engineers will
always confront trade-offs, so much so that making these trade-offs could be
said to be the essence of the activity.

## Truth

{{ note }}
One thing we both believe is that in grappling with problems, if you apply
yourself, you can discover deep platonic truths.  This course/book is about
finding deep truths about programming.
