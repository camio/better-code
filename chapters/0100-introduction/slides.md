{{ note }}
As engineers we have to juggle all of this and make a set of informed
tradeoffs to find the best solution.  Real-world constraints mean engineers will
always confront trade-offs, so much so that making these trade-offs could be
said to be the essence of the activity.

## Truth

{{ note }}
One thing we both believe is that in grappling with problems, if you apply
yourself, you can discover deep platonic truths.  This course/book is about
finding deep truths about programming.
