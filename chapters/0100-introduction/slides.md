***WRITEME: about our backgrounds***

%speaker
: We hope this course/book is generally applicable, but of course we come from a
  set of experiences that will color what we think is important.  We've
  attempted to be responsible for our biases, but in full disclosure, here they
  are.

: This is a course about engineering.  So what do we mean by that?

  - Consulting definitions very useful; we will do that a lot.
  - Wordy definition, but some standout features:
    - it's a creative process
    - Based on scientific principles
    - to create predictable results
    - subject to real-world constraints (functionality, economics, safety, shipping dates,
      cost, Available tooling/hardware, laws of physics…)
    - correctness is provisional. The fact that the computer might get struck by
      lightning doesn't make your code unreliable. “specific:” the provisions are
      *specified*

  As engineers we have to juggle all of this and make a set of informed
  tradeoffs to find the best solution.  Real-world constraints mean engineers will
  always confront trade-offs, so much so that making these trade-offs could be
  said to be the essence of the activity.

%speaker
: One thing we both believe is that in grappling with problems, if you apply
  yourself, you can discover deep platonic truths.  This course/book is about
  finding deep truths about programming.
